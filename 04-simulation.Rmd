# Simulation and Randomization {#ch4}

NOTE: Simulation modeling happens to be one of the author's favorite parts of using R, so this Chapter will likely be quite long.

This chapter is intended also to provide the reader with more experience on writing more advanced functions. 

**Topics:**

*  For loops
*  Use of random deviates
*  More summaries: probabilities, etc.

**Examples:**

*  Simulation
    *  A basic monte carlo experiment: validate `rnorm` using `qnorm` and `pnorm`
    *  Harvest-policy analysis
    *  Mark-recapture evaluation
    *  Stochastic power analysis
* Randomization
    *  Permutation tests
    *  The bootstrap
