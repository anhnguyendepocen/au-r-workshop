# Overview{-}

This is intended to be a first course in R programming. It is by no means comprehensive, but instead attempts to introduce the main topics needed to get a beginner up and running with applying R to their own work. There will be no prior knowledge assumed on the part of the student regarding R or programming. In the later chapters, e.g., Chapters \@ref(ch3) and \@ref(ch4), an understanding of statistics at the introductory undergraduate level would be helpful.
