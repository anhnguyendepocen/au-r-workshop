You will learn: the use of R as a basic calculator some basic object types some basic data classes some basic data structures how to read in data how to write out data how to write your own functions Before You Begin: Install R and RStudio First off, you will need to get R and RStudio1 onto your computer. Please see Appendix A for details on installing these programs on your operating system. 1.1 The R Studio Interface Once you open up R Studio for the first time, you will see three panes: the left hand side is the console where results from executed commands are printed, and the two panes on the right are for additional information to help you code more efficiently - don’t worry too much about what these are at the moment. For now, focus your attention on the console. 1.1.1 Write Some Simple Code To start off, you will just use R as a calculator. Type these commands (not the lines with ##, those are output2) one at a time and hit CTRL + ENTER to run it. The spaces don’t matter at all, they are used here for clairity and for styling.3 3 + 3 ## [1] 6 12/4 ## [1] 3 Notice that when you run each line, it prints the command and the output to the console. R is an object oriented language, which means that you fill objects with data do things with them. Make an object called x that stores the result of the calculation 3 + 3 (type this and run using CTRL + ENTER): x = 3 + 3 Notice that running this line did not return a value as before. This is because in that line you are assigning a value to the object x. You can view the contents of x by typing its name alone and running just that: x ## [1] 6 When used this way, the = sign denotes assignment of the value on the right-hand side to an object with the name on the left-hand side. The &lt;- serves this same purpose so in this context the two are interchangable: y &lt;- 2 + 5 You can highlight smaller sections of a line to run as well. For example after creating y above, press the up arrow to see the line you just ran, highlight just the y, and press CTRL + ENTER. From this point forward, the verb “run” means execute some code using CTRL + ENTER. You can use your objects together to make a new object: z = y - x 1.2 Saving Your Code: Scripts If you closed R at this moment, your work would be lost. Running code in the console like you have just done does not save a record of your work. To save R code, you must use what is called a script, which is a plain-text file with the extension .R. To create a new script file, go to File &gt; New File &gt; R Script, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + N. A new pane will open called the source pane - this is where you will edit your code and save your progress. R Scripts are a key feature of reproducible research with R, given that if they are well-written they can present a complete roadmap of your statistical analysis and workflow. 1.3 The Working Directory You will want to save your hard work. A key part of doing saving your work is thinking about where you save it. In R, a key concept is the working directory. This is the location (i.e., folder) on your computer where your current R session will “talk to” by default. The working directory is where R will read files from and write files to by default, and is where all of your data should be stored for your analysis in R. Because you’ll likely be visiting it often, it should probably be somewhere that is easy to remember and not too deeply buried in your computer’s file system. Save your script somewhere like C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Chapter1 on your computer. To set the working directory to this location, you have three options: Go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Source File Location. This will set the working directory to the location of the file that is currently open in your source pane. Go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory. This will open an interactive file selection window to allow you to navigate to the desired directory. Use code. In the console, you can type setwd(&quot;C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Chapter1&quot;). If at any point you want to know where your current working directory is set to, you can either look at the top of the console pane, which shows the full path or by running getwd() in the console. The main benefits of using a working directory are: Files are read from and written to a consistent and predictable place everytime Everything for your analysis is organized into one place You don’t have to continously type file paths to your work. If file.txt is a file in your current working directory, you can reference it your R session using &quot;file.txt&quot; rather than with &quot;C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Chapter1/file.txt&quot; each time. 1.4 R Object Types R has a variety of object types that you will need to become familiar with. 1.4.1 Functions Much of your work in R will involve functions. A function is called using the syntax: fun(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2) Here, fun is the function name and arg1 and arg2 are called arguments. Functions take input in the form of the arguments, do some task with them, then return some output. The parentheses are a sure sign that fun is a function. We have passed the function two arguments by name: all functions have arguments, all arguments have names, and there is always a default order to the arguments. If you memorize the argument order of functions you use frequently, you don’t have to specify the argument name: fun(value1, value2) would give the same result as the command above in which the argument names were specified. Here’s a real example: print(x = z) ## [1] 1 The function is print, the argument is x, and the value we have supplied the argument is the object z. The task that print does is to print the value of z to the console. R has lots of built-in information to help you learn how to use a function. Take a look at the help file for the mean function. Run ?mean in the console: a window on the right-hand side of the R Studio interface should open. The help file tells you what goes into a function and what comes out. For more complex functions it also tells you what all of the options (i.e., arguments) can do. Help files can be a bit intimidating to interpret at first, but they are all organized the same and once you learn their layout you will know where to go to find the information you’re looking for. 1.4.2 Vectors Vectors are one of the most common data structures. A vector is a set of numbers going in only one dimension. Each position in a vector is termed an element, and the number of elements is termed the length of the vector. Here are some ways to make some vectors with different elements, all of length five: # this is a comment. R will ignore all text on a line after a # # the ; means run everything after it on a new line # count up by 1 month = 2:6; month ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 # count up by 2 day = seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2); day ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 # repeat the same number (repeat 2018 5 times) year = rep(2018, 5); year ## [1] 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 The [1] that shows up is a element position, more on this later (see Section 1.7). If you wish to know how many elements are in a vector, use length: length(year) ## [1] 5 You can also create a vector “by-hand” using the c function4: # a numeric vector number = c(4, 7, 8, 10, 15); number ## [1] 4 7 8 10 15 # a character vector pond = c(&quot;F11&quot;, &quot;S28&quot;, &quot;S30&quot;, &quot;S8&quot;, &#39;S11&#39;); pond ## [1] &quot;F11&quot; &quot;S28&quot; &quot;S30&quot; &quot;S8&quot; &quot;S11&quot; Note the difference between the numeric and character vectors. The the terms “numeric” and “character”&quot; represent data classes, which specify the type of data the vector is holding: A numeric vector stores numbers. You can do math with numeric vectors A character vector stores what are essentially letters. You can’t do math with letters. A character vector is easy to spot because the elements will be wrapped with quotes5. A vector can only hold one data class at a time: v = c(1,2,3,&quot;a&quot;); v ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;a&quot; Notice how all the elements now have quotes around them. The numbers have been coerced to characters6. If we attempted to calculate the sum of our vector: sum(v) ## Error in sum(v): invalid &#39;type&#39; (character) of argument we would find that it is impossible in its current form. 1.4.3 Matrices Matrices act just like vectors, but they are in two dimensions, i.e., they have both rows and columns. One easy way to make a matrix is by combining vectors you have already made: # combine vectors by column (each vector will become a column) m1 = cbind(month, day, year, number); m1 ## month day year number ## [1,] 2 1 2018 4 ## [2,] 3 3 2018 7 ## [3,] 4 5 2018 8 ## [4,] 5 7 2018 10 ## [5,] 6 9 2018 15 # combine vectors by row (each vector will become a row) m2 = rbind(month, day, year, number); m2 ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## month 2 3 4 5 6 ## day 1 3 5 7 9 ## year 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 ## number 4 7 8 10 15 Just like vectors, matrices can hold only one data class (note the coersion of numbers to characters): cbind(m1, pond) ## month day year number pond ## [1,] &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;F11&quot; ## [2,] &quot;3&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;S28&quot; ## [3,] &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;S30&quot; ## [4,] &quot;5&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;S8&quot; ## [5,] &quot;6&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;15&quot; &quot;S11&quot; 1.4.4 Data Frames Many data sets you will work with require storing different data classes in different columns, which would rule out the use of a matrix. This is where data frames come in: df1 = data.frame(month, day, year, number, pond); df1 ## month day year number pond ## 1 2 1 2018 4 F11 ## 2 3 3 2018 7 S28 ## 3 4 5 2018 8 S30 ## 4 5 7 2018 10 S8 ## 5 6 9 2018 15 S11 Notice the lack of quotation marks which indicates that all variables (i.e., columns) are stored as their original data class. It is important to know what kind of object type you are using, since R treats them differently. For example, some functions can only use a certain object type. The same holds true for data classes (numeric vs. character).You can quickly determine what kind of object you are dealing with by using the class function. Simply run class(object.name): class(day); class(pond); class(m1); class(df1) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; 1.5 Factors At this point, it is worthwhile to introduce an additional data class: factors. Notice the class of the pond variable in df1: class(df1$pond) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; The character vector pond was coerced to a factor when you placed it in the data frame. A vector with a factor class is like a character vector in that you see letters and that you can’t do math on it. However, a factor has additional properties: in particular, it is a grouping variable. See what happens when you print the pond variable: df1$pond ## [1] F11 S28 S30 S8 S11 ## Levels: F11 S11 S28 S30 S8 That looks weird, huh? A factor has levels, with each level being a subcategory of the factor. You can see the unique levels of your factor by running: levels(df1$pond) ## [1] &quot;F11&quot; &quot;S11&quot; &quot;S28&quot; &quot;S30&quot; &quot;S8&quot; Additionally, factor levels have an assigned order (even if the levels are totally nominal), which will become important in Chapter 3 when you learn how to fit linear models to groups of data, in which one level is the “reference” group that all other groups are compared to. If you’re running into errors about R expecting character vectors, it may be because they are actually stored as factors. When you make a data frame, you’ll often have the option to turn off the automatic factor coersion. For example: data.frame(month, day, year, number, pond, stringsAsFactors = F) read.csv(&quot;streams.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F) # see below for details on read.csv will result in character vectors remaining that way as opposed to being coerced to factors. This can be preferable if you are doing many string manipulations, as character vectors are often easier to work with than factors. 1.6 Vector Math R does vectorized calculations. This means that if supplied with two numeric vectors of equal length and a mathematical operator, R will perform the calculation on each pair of elements. For example, if you wanted to add the two vectors vector day and month, then you would just run: dm = day + month; dm ## [1] 3 6 9 12 15 You typically should ensure that the vectors you are doing math with are of equal lengths. You could do the same calculation to each element (e.g., divide each element by 2) with: dm/2 ## [1] 1.5 3.0 4.5 6.0 7.5 1.7 Data Queries/Subsets/Retrievals This perhaps the most important and versatile skills to know in R. So you have an object with data in it and you want to use it for analysis. But you don’t want the whole dataset. You want to use just a few rows or just a few columns, or perhaps you need just a single element from a vector. This section is devoted to ways you can extract certain parts of a data object (the terms query and subset are often used interchangeably to describe this task). There are three main methods: By Index – This method allows you to pull out specific rows/columns by their location in an object. However, you must know exactly where in the object the desired data are. An index is a location of a element in a data object, like the element position or the position of a specific row or column. To subset by index, you specify the object, then what rows, then what columns. The syntax for subsetting a vector by index is vector[element] and for a matrix it is matrix[row,column]. Here are some examples # show all of day, then subset the third element day; day[3] ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 ## [1] 5 # show all of m1, then subset the cell in row 1 col 3 m1; m1[1,3] ## month day year number ## [1,] 2 1 2018 4 ## [2,] 3 3 2018 7 ## [3,] 4 5 2018 8 ## [4,] 5 7 2018 10 ## [5,] 6 9 2018 15 ## year ## 2018 # show all of df1, then subset the entire first column df1; df1[,1] ## month day year number pond ## 1 2 1 2018 4 F11 ## 2 3 3 2018 7 S28 ## 3 4 5 2018 8 S30 ## 4 5 7 2018 10 S8 ## 5 6 9 2018 15 S11 ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 Note this last line: the [,1] says “keep all the rows, but take only the first column”. Here is another example: # show m1, then subset the 1st, 2nd, and 4th rows and every column m1; m1[c(1,2,4),] ## month day year number ## [1,] 2 1 2018 4 ## [2,] 3 3 2018 7 ## [3,] 4 5 2018 8 ## [4,] 5 7 2018 10 ## [5,] 6 9 2018 15 ## month day year number ## [1,] 2 1 2018 4 ## [2,] 3 3 2018 7 ## [3,] 5 7 2018 10 Notice how you can pass a vector of row indices here to exclude the 3rd and 5th rows. 2. By name – This method allows you to pull out a specific column of data based on what the column name is. Of course, the column must have a name first. The name method uses the $ operator: df1$month ## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 You can combine these two methods: df1$month[3] ## [1] 4 # or df1[,&quot;year&quot;] ## [1] 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 The by name ($) method is useful because it can be used to add columns to a data frame: df1$dm = df1$day + df1$month; df1 ## month day year number pond dm ## 1 2 1 2018 4 F11 3 ## 2 3 3 2018 7 S28 6 ## 3 4 5 2018 8 S30 9 ## 4 5 7 2018 10 S8 12 ## 5 6 9 2018 15 S11 15 Logical Subsetting – This is perhaps the most flexible method, and is described in Section 1.11. EXERCISE 1A Take a break to apply what you’ve learned so far. In this exercise, you’ll be using what you learned about creating objects and the differences between different data classes. You will be entering this data frame into R by hand and doing some basic data subsets. Lake Area Time Fish Big 100 1000 643 Small 25 1200 203 Square 45 1400 109 Circle 30 1600 15 Create a new file called Ex_1A.R. Set the working directory to the folder containing Ex_1A.R. Enter these data into vectors. Call the vectors whatever you would like. Should you enter the data as vectors by rows, or by columns? (Hint: remember the properties of vectors). Combine your vectors into a data frame. Why should you use a data frame instead of a matrix? Subset all of the data from Small Lake. Subset the area for all of the lakes. Subset the number of fish for Big and Square lakes. You realize that you sampled 209 fish at Square Lake, not 109. Fix the mistake. There are two ways to do this, can you think of them both? Which do you think is better? Save your script. Close R and re-open your script to see that it was saved. 1.8 Read External Data Files It is rare that you will enter data by hand as you did in Exercise 1A. Often, you have a dataset that you wish to analyze or manipulate. R has several ways to read information from data files and in this workshop, we will be using a common and simple method: reading in .csv files. .csv files are data files that separate columns with commas7. If your data are in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, you can save your spreadsheet file as a CSV file (File &gt; Save As &gt; Save as Type&gt; CSV (Comma Delimited)). Several dialog boxes will open asking if you are sure you want to save it as a .csv file. The syntax for reading in a .csv file is: dat = read.csv(&quot;FileName.csv&quot;) The data files for this workshop are found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/bstaton1/au-r-workshop-data/tree/master. Navigate to this repository, find the file called streams.csv, download that file8, and place it in your working directory for this session. This document assumes your working directory is C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Chapter1, though the one you are actually using may be slightly different. We can read the contents of streams.csv into R using this code (ensure your working directory is set first): dat = read.csv(&quot;streams.csv&quot;) If the data set is in your working directory, all you need to provide is the file name. If you do not get an error, congratulations! However, if you get an error that looks like this: ## Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file &#39;streams.csv&#39;: No such file ## or directory ## Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection then fear not. This has must be among the most common errors encoutered by R users world-wide. It simply means the file you told R to look for doesn’t exist where you told R to find it. Here is a trouble-shooting guide to this error: The exact case and spelling matters, as well as do the quotes and .csv at the end. Ensure the file name is typed correctly. Check what files are in your working directory: run dir(). This will return a vector with the names of the files located in your working directory. Is the file you told R was there truly in there? Is your working directory set to where you thought it was? If the file is not in your working directory, and you wish to keep it that way, you must point R to where that file is. Pretend for a moment that we put the data file in /R-Workshop/DataHere. Here are two examples that would both read in the file in this case: dat = read.csv(&quot;C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Data/streams.csv&quot;) dat = read.csv(&quot;../Data/streams&quot;) The first line is the full file path to the file in question. The second line uses a relative path: the ../ says “look one folder up from the working directory for a folder called Data then find a file called streams.csv in it.” If you did not get any errors, then the data are in the object you named (dat here) and that object is a data frame. Do not proceed until you are able to read.csv to run successfully. A few things to note about reading in .csv files: If even a single character is found in a numeric column in FileName.csv, the entire column will be coerced to a character/factor data class after it is read in (i.e., no more math with data on that column until you remove the character). A common error is to have a #VALUE! record left over from an invalid Excel function result. You must remove all of these occurences in order to use that column as numeric. Characters include anything other than a number ([0-9]) and a period when used as a decimal. None of these characters: !@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=[a-z];[A-Z] should never be found in a column you wish to do math with (e.g., take the mean of that column). If a record (i.e., cell) is truly missing and you wish R to treat it that way (i.e., as an NA), you have three options: Hard code an NA into that cell in Excel Leave that cell completely empty Enter in some other character (e.g., &quot;.&quot;) alone in all cells that are meant to be coded as NA in R and use the na.strings = &quot;.&quot; argument of read.csv. If a cell in the first row with text contains a space between two words, R will insert a &quot;.&quot; between the words. If your data have column names (i.e., characters) in the first row, R will bring those in as column names by default. R brings in CSV files in as data frames by default. If at some point you did “Clear Contents” in Microsoft Excel to delete rows or columns from your .csv file, these deleted rows/columns will be read in as all NAs, which can be annoying. To remove this problem, open the .csv file in Excel, then highlight and delete the rows/columns and save the file. Read it back into R again using read.csv. 1.9 Explore the Data Set Have a look at the data. You could just run dat to view the contents of the object, but it will show the whole thing, which may be undesirable if the data set is large. To view the first handful of rows, run head(dat) or the last handful of rows with tail(dat). You will now use some basic functions to explore the streams data before any analysis. The summary function is very useful for getting a coarse look at how R has interpretted the data frame: summary(dat) ## state stream_width flow ## Alabama :5 Min. :17.65 Min. : 28.75 ## Florida :5 1st Qu.:46.09 1st Qu.: 65.50 ## Georgia :5 Median :61.80 Median : 95.64 ## Tennessee:5 Mean :60.88 Mean : 91.49 ## 3rd Qu.:79.34 3rd Qu.:120.55 ## Max. :94.65 Max. :149.54 ## NA&#39;s :1 You can see the spread of the numeric data and see the different levels of the factor (state) as well as how many data points belong to each category. Note that there is one NA in the variable called flow. To count the number of elements in a variable (or any vector), remember the length function: length(dat$stream_width) ## [1] 20 Note that R counts missing values as elements as well: length(dat$flow) ## [1] 20 To get the dimensions of an object with more than one dimension (i.e., a data frame or matrix) we can use the dim function. This returns a vector with two elements: the first number is the number of rows and the second is the number of columns. If you only want one of these, use the nrow or ncol functions (but remember, only for objects with more than one dimension; vectors don’t have rows or columns!). dim(dat); nrow(dat); ncol(dat) ## [1] 20 3 ## [1] 20 ## [1] 3 You can extract the names of the variables (i.e., columns) in the data frame using colnames: colnames(dat) ## [1] &quot;state&quot; &quot;stream_width&quot; &quot;flow&quot; Calculate the mean of all of the flow records: mean(dat$flow) ## [1] NA It returned an NA because there is an NA in the data for this variable. There is a way to tell R to ignore this NA. Include the argument na.rm = TRUE in the mean function (separate arguments are always separated by commas). This is a logical argument, meaning that it asks a question. It says “do you want to remove NAs before calculating the mean?” TRUE means “yes” and FALSE means “no.” These can be abbreviated as T or F. Many of R’s functions have the na.rm argument (e.g. mean, sd, var, min, max, sum, etc. - most anything that collapses a vector into one number). mean(dat$flow, na.rm = T) ## [1] 91.49053 which is the same as (i.e., the definition of the mean with the NA removed): sum(dat$flow, na.rm = T)/(nrow(dat) - 1) ## [1] 91.49053 What if you need to do something to more than one variable at a time? One of the easiest ways to do this (though as with most things in R, there are many) is by using the apply function. This function applies the same summary function to individual subsets of a data object at a time then returns the individual summaries all at once: apply(dat[,2:3], 2, FUN = var, na.rm = T) ## stream_width flow ## 581.1693 1337.3853 The first argument is the data object you want to apply the function to. The second argument (the number 2) specifies that you want to apply the function to columns, 1 would tell R to apply it to rows. The FUN argument specifies what function you wish to apply to each of the columns; here we are calculating the variance which takes the na.rm = T argument. This use of apply alone is very powerful and can help you get around having to write the dreaded for loop (introduced in Chapter 4). There is a whole family of apply functions, the base apply is the most basic but a more sophisticated one is tapply, which applies a function based on some grouping variable (a factor). Calculate the mean stream width separated by state: tapply(dat$stream_width, dat$state, mean) ## Alabama Florida Georgia Tennessee ## 53.664 63.588 54.996 71.290 The first argument is the variable you want to apply the mean function to, the second is the grouping variable, and the third is what function you wish to apply. Try to commit this command to memory given this is a pretty common task. 1.10 Logical/Boolean Operators To be an efficient and capable programmer in any language, you will need to become familiar with how to implement numerical logic, i.e., the boolean operators. These are very useful because they always return a TRUE or a FALSE, off of which program-based decisions can be made (e.g., whether to operate a given subroutine, whether to keep certain rows, whether to print the output, etc.). Define a simple object: x = 5 . Note that this will write over what was previously stored in the object x. We wish to ask some questions of the new x, and the answer will be printed to the console as a TRUE for “yes” and a FALSE for “no”. Below are the common Boolean operators. Equality To ask if x is exactly equal to 5, you run: x == 5 ## [1] TRUE Note the use of the double equals-sign to denote equality as opposed to the single = as used in assignment when you ran x = 5 a minute ago. Inequalities To ask if x is not equal to 5, you run: x != 5 ## [1] FALSE To ask if x is less than 5, you run: x &lt; 5 ## [1] FALSE To ask if x is less than or equal to 5, you run: x &lt;= 5 ## [1] TRUE Greater than works the same way, though with the &gt; symbol replaced. And Suppose you have two conditions, and you want to know if both are met. For this you would use and by running: x &gt; 4 &amp; x &lt; 6 ## [1] TRUE which asks if x is between 4 and 6. Or Suppose you have two conditions, and you want to know if either are met. For this you would use or by running: x &lt;= 5 | x &gt; 5 ## [1] TRUE which asks if x is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5 - you would be hard-pressed to find a real number that did not meet these conditions! 1.11 Logical Subsetting A critical use of logical/Boolean operators is in the subsetting of data objects. You can use a logical vector (i.e., one made of only TRUE and FALSE elements) to tell R to extract only those elements corresponding to the TRUE records. For example: # here&#39;s logical vector: TRUE everywhere condition met dat$stream_width &gt; 60 ## [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE ## [12] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE # insert it to see only the flows for the TRUE elmements dat$flow[dat$stream_width &gt; 60] ## [1] 120.48 123.78 95.64 95.82 120.06 135.63 120.61 111.34 149.54 131.22 gives all of the flow values for which stream_width is greater than 60. To see all of the data from Alabama, you would run: dat[dat$state == &quot;Alabama&quot;,] ## state stream_width flow ## 1 Alabama 81.68 120.48 ## 2 Alabama 57.76 85.90 ## 3 Alabama 48.32 73.38 ## 4 Alabama 31.63 46.55 ## 5 Alabama 48.93 80.91 You will be frequently revisiting this skill throughout the workshop. 1.12 if, else, and ifelse You can tell R to do something if the result of a question is TRUE. This is a typical if-then statement: if (x == 5) print(&quot;x is equal to 5&quot;) ## [1] &quot;x is equal to 5&quot; This says “if x equals 5, then print the phrase ‘x is equal to 5’ to the console”. If the logical returns a FALSE, then this command does nothing: if (x != 5) print(&quot;x is equal to 5&quot;) We can tell R to do multiple things if the logical is TRUE by using curly braces: if (x == 5) { print(&quot;x is equal to 5&quot;) print(&quot;you dummy, x is supposed to be 6&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is equal to 5&quot; ## [1] &quot;you dummy, x is supposed to be 6&quot; You can always use curly braces to extend code across multiple lines whereas it may have been intended to go on one line. What if you want R to do something if the logical is FALSE? Then you would use the else command: if (x &gt; 5) print(&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;) else print(&quot;x is not greater than 5&quot;) ## [1] &quot;x is not greater than 5&quot; Or extend this same thing to multiple lines: if (x &gt; 5) { print(&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;) } else { print(&quot;x is not greater than 5&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;x is not greater than 5&quot; The if function is useful, but it can only ask one question at a time. If you supply it with a vector of length greater than 1, it will give a warning: # vector from -5 to 5, excluding zero xs = c(-5:-1, 1:5) # attempt a logical decision if (xs &lt; 0) print(&quot;negative&quot;) ## Warning in if (xs &lt; 0) print(&quot;negative&quot;): the condition has length &gt; 1 and ## only the first element will be used ## [1] &quot;negative&quot; Warnings are different than errors in that something still happens, but it tells you that it might not be what you wanted, whereas an error stops R altogether. In short, this warning is telling you that you passed if a logical vector with more than 1 element, and that it can only use one element so it’s picking the first one. Because the first element of xs is -5, xs &lt; 0 evaluated to TRUE, and we got a &quot;negative&quot; printed along with our warning. To ask multiple questions at once, we must use ifelse. This function is similar, but it combines the if and else syntax into one useful function function: ifelse(xs &gt; 0, &quot;positive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;) ## [1] &quot;negative&quot; &quot;negative&quot; &quot;negative&quot; &quot;negative&quot; &quot;negative&quot; &quot;positive&quot; ## [7] &quot;positive&quot; &quot;positive&quot; &quot;positive&quot; &quot;positive&quot; The syntax is ifelse(condition, do_if_TRUE, do_if_FALSE). You can cbind the output with xs to verify it worked: cbind( xs, ifelse(xs &gt; 0, &quot;positive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;) ) ## xs ## [1,] &quot;-5&quot; &quot;negative&quot; ## [2,] &quot;-4&quot; &quot;negative&quot; ## [3,] &quot;-3&quot; &quot;negative&quot; ## [4,] &quot;-2&quot; &quot;negative&quot; ## [5,] &quot;-1&quot; &quot;negative&quot; ## [6,] &quot;1&quot; &quot;positive&quot; ## [7,] &quot;2&quot; &quot;positive&quot; ## [8,] &quot;3&quot; &quot;positive&quot; ## [9,] &quot;4&quot; &quot;positive&quot; ## [10,] &quot;5&quot; &quot;positive&quot; Use ifelse to create a new variable in dat that indicateds whether stream is big or small depending whether stream with is greater or less than 50: dat$size_cat = ifelse(dat$stream_width &gt; 50, &quot;big&quot;, &quot;small&quot;); head(dat) ## state stream_width flow size_cat ## 1 Alabama 81.68 120.48 big ## 2 Alabama 57.76 85.90 big ## 3 Alabama 48.32 73.38 small ## 4 Alabama 31.63 46.55 small ## 5 Alabama 48.93 80.91 small ## 6 Georgia 39.42 57.63 small This says “make a new variable in the data frame dat called size_cat and assign each row a ‘big’ if stream_width is greater than 50 and a ‘small’ if less than 50”. One neat thing about ifelse is that you can nest multiple statements inside another9. What if we wanted three categories: ‘small’, ‘medium’, and ‘large’? dat$size_cat_fine = ifelse(dat$stream_width &lt;= 40, &quot;small&quot;, ifelse(dat$stream_width &gt; 40 &amp; dat$stream_width &lt;= 70, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;big&quot;)); head(dat) ## state stream_width flow size_cat size_cat_fine ## 1 Alabama 81.68 120.48 big big ## 2 Alabama 57.76 85.90 big medium ## 3 Alabama 48.32 73.38 small medium ## 4 Alabama 31.63 46.55 small small ## 5 Alabama 48.93 80.91 small medium ## 6 Georgia 39.42 57.63 small small If the first condition is TRUE, then it will give that row a “small”. If not, it will start another ifelse to ask if the stream_width is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 70. If so, it will give it a “medium”, if not it will get a “big”. This is confusing at first. Not all nesting or embedding of functions are this complex, but this is a neat example. Without ifelse, you would have to use as many if statements as there are elements in dat$stream_width. 1.13 Writing Output Files 1.13.1 .csv Files Now that you have made some new variables in your data frame, you may want to save this work in the form of a new .csv file. To do this, you can use the write.csv function: write.csv(dat, &quot;updated_streams.csv&quot;, row.names = F) The first argument is the data frame (or matrix) to write, the second is what you want to call it (don’t forget the .csv!), and row.names = F tells R to not include the row names (because they are just numbers in this case). R puts the file in your working directory unless you tell it otherwise. To put it somewhere else, type in the path with the new file name at the end. 1.13.2 Saving R Objects Another method is to save R objects directly to the working directory. You can save the new data frame using: save(dat, file = &quot;updated_streams&quot;) Then try removing the dat object from your current session (rm(dat)) and loading it back in using: rm(dat); head(dat) # should give error load(file = &quot;updated_streams&quot;) head(dat) # should show first 6 rows 1.14 User-Defined Functions Sometimes you may want R to carry out a specific task, but there is no built-in function to do it. In this case, you can write your own functions. This one of the parts of R that makes it incredibly flexible, though you will only get a small taste of this topic here. We will be going into more detail in later Chapters, particularly in Chapter 5. First, you must think of a name for your function (e.g., myfun). Then, you specify that you want the object myfun to be a function by using using the function function (I know). Then, in parentheses, you specify any arguments that you want to use within the function to carry out the specific task. Open and closed curly braces specify the start and end of you function body, i.e., the code that specifies how it uses the arguments to do its job. Here’s the general syntax for specifying your own function: myfun = function(arg1) { # function body goes here # use arg1 to do something # return something as last step } Write a general function to take any number x to any power y: power = function(x, y){ x^y } After typing and running the function code (the function is an object that must be assigned), try using it: power(x = 5, y = 3) ## [1] 125 Remember, you can nest or embed functions: power(power(5,2),2) ## [1] 625 This is the equivalent of \\((5^2)^2\\). EXERCISE 1B These data are from a hypothetical pond experiment where you added nutrients to some mesocosoms and counted the densities of 4 different zooplankton taxa. In this experiment, there were two ponds, two treatments per pond, and five replicates of each treatment. There is one error in the dataset “ponds.csv” (remember, found in this repository: https://github.com/bstaton1/au-r-workshop-data/tree/master). After you download the data and place it in the appropriate directory, make sure you open this file and fix it before you bring it into R. Refer back to the information about reading in data (Section 1.8) to make sure you find the error. Read in the data to R and assign it to an object. Calculate some basic summary statistics of your data using the summary function. Calculate the mean chlorophyll a for each pond (Hint: pond is a grouping variable) Calculate the mean number of Chaoborus for each treatment in each pond using tapply. (Hint: You can group by two variables with: tapply(dat$var, list(dat$grp1, dat$grp2), fun). Use the more general apply function to calculate the variance for each zooplankton taxa found only in pond S-28. Create a new variable called prod in the data frame that represents the quantity of chlorophyll a in each replicate. If the chlorophyll a in the replicate is greater than 30 give it a “high”, otherwise give it a “low”. (Hint: are you asking a question of a single number or multiple numbers? How should this change the strategy you use?) EXERCISE 1B BONUS Create a new function called product that multiplies two numbers that you specify. Modify your function to print a message to the console and return the value if it meets a condition and to print another message and not return the value if it doesn’t. While it is possible to run R on it’s own, it rather clunky and you are strongly advised to use RStudio given its compactness, neat features, code tools (like syntax and parentheses highlighting).

You will learn: the different types of plotting functions the basics of how to make: scatterplots line bar box-and-whisker plots histograms the basics of how to change plot features like the text displayed, the size of points, and the type of points the basics of multi-panel plotting the basics of the par function how to save your plot to an external file R’s base plotting package is incredibly versatile, and as you will see, it doesn’t take much to get started making professional-looking graphs. Before we get started, I’ll just mention that there are other R packages10 for plotting (e.g. ggplot2 and lattice), but they can be more complex than the base R plotting capabilities and look a bit different. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you did not attend the session corresponding to the Chapter 1 material, you are recommended to walk through those chapters’ contents before proceeding to this material. This is because you will be using some of the commands and terminology presented previously. If you are confused about a topic, you can use CTRL + F to find previous cases where that topic has been discussed in this document. Before You Begin You should create a new directory and R script for your work in this Chapter. Create a new R script called Ch2.R and save it in the directory C:/Users/YOU/Documents/R-Workshop/Chapter2. Set your working directory to that location. Revisit the Sections 1.2 and 1.3 for more details on these steps. 2.1 R Plotting Lingo Learning some terminology will help you get used to the base R graphics system: A high-level plotting function is one that is used to make a new graph. Examples of higher level plotting functions are the general plot and the barplot functions. When-a high level plotting function is executed, the currently displayed plot (if any) is written over. A low-level plotting function is one that is used to modify a plot that is already created. You must already have made a plot using a higher level plotting function before you use lower level plotting functions. Examples include text, points, and lines. When a low-level plotting function is executed, the output is simply added to an existing plot. The graphics device is the area that a plot shows up. R Studio has a built in graphics device in its interface (lower right by default in the “Plots” tab), or you can create a new device. R will plot on the active device, which is the most recently created device. There can only be one active device at a time. Here is an example of a basic R plot: There are a few components: The plotting region: all data information is displayed here. The margin: where axis labels, tick marks, and main plot titles are located The outer margin: by default, there is no outer margin. You can add one if you want to add text here or make more room around the edges. You can change just about everything there is about this plot to suit your tastes. Duplicate this plot, but make the x-axis, y-axis, and main titles other than the placeholders shown here: x = 0:10 y = x^2 plot(x = x, y = y, xlab = &quot;x-axis label goes here&quot;, ylab = &quot;y-axis label goes here&quot;, main = &quot;Main Plot Title Goes Here&quot;) Note that the first two arguments, x and y, specify the coordinates of the points (i.e., the first point is placed at coordinates x[1],y[1]). plot has tons of arguments (or graphical parameters as the help file found using ?plot or ?par calls them) that change how the plot looks. Note that when you want something displayed verbatim on the plotting device, you must wrap that code in &quot; &quot;, i.e., the arguments xlab, ylab, and main all receive a character vector of length 1 as input. Here are just a handful of them to get you started: Table 2.1: Several of the key arguments to high- and low-level plotting functions Arg. Usage Description xlab xlab = &quot;X-AXIS&quot; changes the x-axis label text ylab ylab = &quot;Y-AXIS&quot; changes the y-axis label text main main = &quot;TITLE&quot; changes the main title text cex cex = 1.5 changes the size of symbols in the plotting region11 pch pch = 17 changes the symbol type12 xlim xlim = range(x) changes the endpoints (limits) of the x-axis13 ylim ylim = c(0,1) same as xlim, but for the y-axis type type = &quot;l&quot; changes the way points are connected by lines14 lty lty = 2 changes the line type15 lwd lwd = 2 changes the line width16 col col = &quot;blue&quot; changes the color of plotted objects17 You are advised to try at least some of these arguments out for yourself with your plot(x, y) code from above - notice how every time you run plot, a whole new plot is created, not just the thing you changed. There are definitely other options: check out ?plot or ?par for more details. 2.2 Lower Level Plotting Functions Now that you have a base plot designed to your liking, you might want to add some additional “layers” to it to represent more data or other kind of information like an additional label or text. Add some more points to your plot by putting this line right beneath your plot(x,y) code and run just the points() line (make sure your device is showing a plot first): # rev() reverses a vector: so the old x[1] is x[11] now points(x = rev(x), y = y, col = &quot;blue&quot;, pch = 16) Here, points acted like a low-level plotting function because it added points to a plot you already made. Many of the arguments shown in Table 2.1 can be used in both high-level and low-level plotting functions (notice how col and pch were used in points). Just like points, there is also lines: lines(x = x, y = x, lty = 2, col = &quot;red&quot;) You can also add text to the plotting region: text(x = 5, y = 80, &quot;This is Text&quot;, cex = 1.5, col = &quot;grey&quot;, font = 4) The text is centered on the coordinates you provide. You can also provide vectors of coordinates and text to write different things at once. The easiest way to add a straight line to a plot is with abline. By default it takes two arguments: a and b which are the intercept and slope, respectively, e.g., abline(c(0,1)) will draw a 1:1 line. You can also do abline(h = 5) to draw a horizontal line at 5 or abline(v = 5) to draw a vertical line at 5. You can see that the text is centered on the coordinates x = 5 and y = 80 using abline: abline(h = 80, col = &quot;grey&quot;) abline(v = 5, col = &quot;grey&quot;) If you accidentally add a plot element that you don’t want using a low-level plotting function, the only way to remove it is by re-running the high-level plotting function to start a new plot and adding only the objects you want. Try removing the “This is Text” text and the straight lines you drew with abline from the plot displayed in your device. 2.3 Other High-Level Plotting Functions You have just seen the basics of making two dimensional scatter plots and line plots. You will now explore other types of graphs you can make. 2.3.1 The Bar Graph Another very common graph is a bar graph. R has a bargraph function, and again, it has lots of arguments. Here you will just make two common variations: single bars per group and multiple bars per group. Let’s make up some data to plot: x1 = c(2,4,6) barplot(x1) Notice that there are no group names on our bars (if our vector had names, there would be). You can add names by using the argument names.arg: barplot(x1, names.arg = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)) Add some more information by including two bars per group. Make some more data and combine it with the old data: x2 = c(3,5,7) x3 = rbind(x1, x2) barplot(x3, names.arg = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), beside = T) To add multiple bars per group, R needs a matrix like you just made. The columns store the heights of the bars that will be placed together in a group. Including the beside = T argument tells R to plot all groups as different bars as opposed to using a stacked bar graph. Oftentimes, we want to add error bars to a bar graph like this. To avoid digressing too much here, creating error bars is covered as a bonus topic. 2.4 Box-and-Whisker Plots Box-and-whisker plots are a great way to visualize the spread of your data. All you need to make a box-and-whisker plot is a grouping variable (a factor, revisit Section 1.5 if you don’t remember what these are) and some continuous (i.e., numeric) data for each level of the factor. Download the creel.csv data set from the GitHub repository https://github.com/bstaton1/au-r-workshop-data/tree/master, place it in the same directory as your R script Ch2.R (which is the one you should be working on right now). Read the data in and print a summary: dat = read.csv(&quot;creel.csv&quot;) summary(dat) ## fishery hours ## Harvest :100 Min. :-1.150 ## Non.Tournament:100 1st Qu.: 9.936 ## Tournament :100 Median :20.758 ## Mean :26.050 ## 3rd Qu.:43.896 ## Max. :62.649 This data set contains some simulated (i.e., fake) continuous and categorical data that represent 300 anglers who were creel surveyed18. In the data set, there are three categories (levels to the factor fishery) and the continuous variable is how many hours each angler fished this year. If you supply the generic plot function with a continuous response (y) variable and a categorical predictor (x) variable, it will automatically know that you want to make a box-and-whisker plot: plot(x = dat$fishery, y = dat$hours) In the box-and-whisker plot above, the heavy line is the median, the ends of the boxes are the 25th and 75th percentiles and the “whiskers” are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Any points that are outliers (i.e., fall outside of the whiskers) will be shown as points19. It is worth introducing a shorthand syntax of typing the same command: plot(hours ~ fishery, data = dat) Instead of saying plot(x = x.var, y = y.var), this expression says plot(y.var ~ x.var). The ~ reads “as a function of”. By specifying the data argument, you no longer need to indicate where the variables hours and fishery are found. Many R functions have a data argument that works this same way. It is sometimes preferable to plot variables with this syntax because it is often less code and is also the format of R’s statistical equations20. 2.5 Histograms Another way to show the distribution of a variable is with histograms. These figures show the relative frequencies of observations in different discrete bins. Let’s make a histogram of hours the surveyed tournament anglers fished this year: hist(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Tournament&quot;]) Notice the subset that extracts hours fished for tournament anglers only before plotting. hist automatically selects the number of bins based on the range and resolution of the data. You can specify how many evenly-sized bins you want to plot: # extract the hours for tournament anglers t_hrs = dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Tournament&quot;] # create the bin endpoints nbins = 20 breaks = seq(from = min(t_hrs), to = max(t_hrs), length = nbins + 1) hist(t_hrs, breaks = breaks, main = &quot;Tournament&quot;, col = &quot;grey&quot;) 2.6 The par Function If it bothers you that the axes are “floating”, you can fix this using this command: par(xaxs = &quot;i&quot;, yaxs = &quot;i&quot;) hist(t_hrs, breaks = breaks, main = &quot;Tournament&quot;, col = &quot;grey&quot;) Here, you changed the graphical parameters of the graphics device by using the par argument. Once you change the settings in par, they will remain that way until you start a new device. The par function is central to fine-tuning your graphics. Here, the xaxs = &quot;i&quot; and yaxs = &quot;i&quot; arguments essentially removed the buffer between the data and the axes. par has options to change the size of the margins, add outer margins, change colors, etc. Some of the graphical parameters that can be passed to high- and low-level plotting functions (like those in Table 2.1) can also be passed par. Check out the help file (?par) to see everything it can do. If you want to start over with fresh par settings, start a new device. 2.7 New Temporary Devices If you are using RStudio, then likely all of the plots you have made thus far have shown up in the lower right-hand corner or your RStudio window. You have been using RStudio’s built-in plotting device. If you wish to open a new plotting device (maybe to put it on a separate monitor), you can use the following commands, depending on your operating system: Windows Users – just run windows() to open up a new plotting device. It will become the active device. Mac Users – similarly, you can run quartz() to open a new device. Linux Users – similarly, just run x11(). 2.8 Multi-panel Plots Sometimes you want to display more than one plot at a time. You can make a multi-panel plot which allows for multiple plotting regions to show up simultaneously within the same plotting device. First, you need to change the layout of the plotting region. The easiest way to set up the device for multi-panel plotting is by using the mfrow argument in the par function. Below, the code says “set up change the graphical parameters so that there is 1 row and 3 columns of plotting regions within the device”. Every time you make a new plot, it will go in the next available plotting region. Make 3 histograms, each that represents a different sector of the fishery: par(mfrow = c(1,3)) hist(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Tournament&quot;], main = &quot;Tourn&quot;) hist(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Non.Tournament&quot;], main = &quot;Non.Tourn&quot;) hist(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Harvest&quot;], main = &quot;Harvest&quot;) There are other ways to make multi-panel plots, however, they are beyond the scope of this beginner’s workshop. See ?layout for details. With this function you can change the size of certain plots and make them have different shapes (i.e., some squares, some rectangles, etc.), but it takes some pretty involved (though not impossible, by any means) specification of how you want the device to be split up into regions. 2.9 Legends Oftentimes you will want to add a legend to our plots to help people interpret what it is showing. You can add legends to R plots using the low-level plotting function legend. Add a legend to the bar plot you made earlier with two groups. First, re-make the plot by running the high-level barplot function, but change the colors of the bars to be shades of blue and red. Once you have the plot made, add the legend: barplot(x3, beside = T,names.arg = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), col = c(&quot;skyblue2&quot;, &quot;tomato2&quot;)) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Group 1&quot;, &quot;Group 2&quot;), fill = c(&quot;skyblue2&quot;, &quot;tomato2&quot;)) The box can be removed using the bty = &quot;n&quot; argument and the size can be changed using cex. The position can be specified either with words (like above) or by using x-y coordinates. Here is a more complex example: # 1) extract and sort the hours for two fisheries from fewest hours t_hrs = sort(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Tournament&quot;]) n_hrs = sort(dat$hours[dat$fishery == &quot;Non.Tournament&quot;]) # 2) make the plot: plot for t_hrs only, but ensure xlim covers both groups par(mar = c(4,4,1,1)) # set the margins: 4 lines of margin space on bottom and left, 1 on top and right plot(x = t_hrs, y = 1:length(t_hrs), type = &quot;o&quot;, lty = 2, xlim = range(c(t_hrs, n_hrs)), xlab = &quot;Hours Fished/Year&quot;, ylab = &quot;Rank within Fishery Samples&quot;, las = 1) # las = 1 says &quot;turn the y-axis tick labels to be horizontal&quot; # 3) add info for the other fishery points(x = n_hrs, y = 1:length(n_hrs), type = &quot;o&quot;, lty = 1, pch = 16) # 4) add the legend legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Tournament&quot;, &quot;Non-Tournament&quot;), lty = c(2,1), pch = c(1, 16), bty = &quot;n&quot;) Notice that you need to be careful about the order of how you specify which lty and pch settings match up with the elements of the legend argument. In the plot code, you specified that the lty = 2 but didn’t specify what pch should be (it defaults to 1). So when you put the “Tournament” group first the the legend argument vector, you must be sure to use the corresponding plotting codes. The first element of the lty argument matches up with the first element of legend, and so on. There are a few other plotting tricks used: changing the margins using par(mar) and the rotation of y-axis tick mark labels using las = 1. 2.10 Exporting Plots There are two main ways to save plots. First is a quick-and-dirty method that saves the plots, but they are not high-resolution. The second method produces cleaner-looking high-resolution plots. 2.11 First Method (Click Save) If your plot is in the RStudio built-in graphics device: Right above the plot, click Export &gt; Save as Image. Change the name, dimensions and file type. If your plot is in a plotting device window (opened with windows() or quartz(): Simply go to File &gt; Save. All plots will be saved in the working directory by default. You can also just copy the plot to your clipboard (File &gt; Copy to the clipboard &gt; bitmap) and paste it where you want. 2.12 Second Method (Use a function to dump in a new file) If you are producing plots for a final report or publication, you want the output to be as clean-looking as possible. You can save high-resolution plots through R by using the following steps: # step 1: Make a pixels per inch object ppi = 600 # step 2: Call the figure file creation function png(&quot;TestFigure.png&quot;, h = 8 * ppi, w = 8 * ppi, res = ppi) # step 3: Run the plot # put all of your plotting code here (without windows()) # step 4: Close the device dev.off() A plot will be saved in your working directory containing the plot made by the code in step 3 above. The ppi object is pixels-per-inch. When you specify h = 8 * ppi, you are saying “make a plot with height equal to 8 inches”. There are similar functions to make PDFs, tiff files, jpegs, etc. 2.13 Bonus Topic: Error Bars Rarely do we ever present estimates without some measure of uncertainty. The most common way for visualizing the uncertainty in an estimate is by using error bars. Error bars can be added to a plot using the arrows function. For arrows, you need: Vectors of the x and y coordinates of the lower bound of the error bar Vectors of the x and y coordinates of the upper bound of the error bar The syntax for arrows is as follows: arrows(x0, y0, x1, y1, ...), where x0 and y0 are the coordinates you are drawing “from” (e.g., lower limits) and the x1 and y1 are the coordinates you are drawing “to” (e.g., upper limits). The ... represents other arguments to change how the error bars look. Let’s use a simple example. Calculate the mean and standard deviations of the different fishery sectors (remember how tapply works?): Create error bars on the following graph: x_bar = tapply(dat$hours, dat$fishery, mean) barplot(x_bar) where the error bars represent 95% confidence intervals on the mean. You can create a 95% confidence interval using this basic formula: \\[ \\bar{x} \\pm 1.96 * SE(\\bar{x}) \\] where \\[\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i^n{x_i}\\] and \\[SE(\\bar{x})=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i^n{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}}\\] Begin by creating a function to calculate the standard error (\\(SE(\\bar{x})\\)): calc_se = function(x) { sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(length(x) - 1)) } Then calculate the standard errors for each fishery type: se = tapply(dat$hours, dat$fishery, calc_se) Then calculate the lower and upper limits of your bars: lwr = x_bar - 1.96 * se upr = x_bar + 1.96 * se Then draw them on using the arrows function: mp = barplot(x_bar, ylim = range(c(lwr, upr))) arrows(x0 = mp, y0 = lwr, x1 = mp, y1 = upr, length = 0.1, angle = 90, code = 3) Notice four things: The use of mp to specify the x coordinate. If you do mp = barplot(...), mp will contain the x coordinates of the midpoint of each bar. x0 and x1 are the same: you wish to have vertical bars, so these must be the same while y1 and y2 differ. The use of ylim = range(c(lwr, upr)): you want the y-axis to show the full range of all the error bars. The three arguments at the end of arrows: length = 0.1: the length of the arrow heads, fiddle with this until you like it. angle = 90: the angle of the arrow heads, you want 90 here for the error bars. code = 3: indicates that arrow heads should be drawn on both ends of the arrow. EXERCISE 2 For this exercise, you will be making a few of plots and changing how they look to suit your taste. You will use a real dataset this time from a sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) population from the Columbia/Snake River system. This population spawns in Redfish Lake in Idaho, which feeds into the Salmon River which is a tributary of the Snake River. In order to reach the lake, the sockeye salmon must successfully pass through a total eight dams that have fish passage mechanisms in place. The Redfish Lake population is one of the most endangered sockeye populations in the U.S. and travels farther (1,448 km), higher (1,996 m), and is the southernmost population of all sockeye populations in the world (Kline and Flagg 2014). Given this uniqueness, a captive breeding program was initiated in 1991 to preserve the genes from this population. These data came from both hatchery-raised and wild fish and include average female spawner weight (g), fecundity (number of eggs), egg size (eggs/g), and % survival to the eyed-egg stage. Create a new R script called Ex2.R and save it in the Chapter2 directory. Download the sockeye.csv data set from GitHub and read it into R. Produce a basic summary of the data and take note of the data classes, missing values (NA), and the relative ranges for each variable. Make a histogram of fish weights for only hatchery-origin fish. Set breaks = 10 so you can see the distribution more clearly. Make a scatter plot of the fecundity of females as a function of their body weight for wild fish only. Use whichever plotting character (pch) and color (col) you wish. Change the main title and axes labels to reflect what they mean. Change the x-axis limits to be 600 to 3000 and the y-axis limits to be 0 to 3500. (Hint: The NAs will not cause a problem. R will only use points where there is data for both x and y and ignore otherwise). Add points that do the same thing but for hatchery fish. Use a different plotting character and a different color. Add a legend to the plot to differentiate between the two types of fish. Make a multi-panel plot in a new window with box-and-whisker plots that compare (1) spawner weight, (2) fecundity, and (3) egg size between hatchery and wild fish. (Hint: each comparison will be on its own panel). Change the titles of each plot to reflect what you are comparing. Save the plot as a .png file in your working directory with a file name of your choosing. 2.13.1 EXERCISE 2 BONUS Make a bar plot comparing the mean survival to eyed-egg stage for each type of fish (hatchery and wild). Add error bars that represent +/- 2SE of each mean. Change the names of each bar, the main plot title, and the y-axis title. Reference for data Kline, P.A. and T.A. Flagg. 2014.
